    "\n",
    "> **Abtract**: We explore the possibility that overnight returns can serve as a measure of firm-specific investor sentiment by analyzing whether they exhibit characteristics expected of a sentiment measure. First, we document short-term persistence in overnight returns, consistent with existing evidence of short-term persistence in share demand of sentiment-influenced retail investors. Second, we find that short-term persistence is stronger for harder-to-value firms, consistent with evidence that sentiment plays a larger role when there is less objective data available for valuation. Third, we show that stocks with high (low) overnight returns underperform (outperform) over the longer-term, consistent with evidence of temporary sentiment-driven mispricing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **p 2, I**: The recent work of Berkman, Koch, Tuttle, and Zhang (2012) suggests that a stockâ€™s\n",
    "overnight (close-to-open) return can serve as a measure of firm-level sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **p 3, I**: Specifically, Berkman et al. (2012) find that attention-generating events (high absolute returns or\n",
    "strong net buying by retail investors) on one day lead to higher demand by individual investors,\n",
    "concentrated near the open of the next trading day...This creates temporary price pressure at the\n",
    "open, resulting in elevated overnight returns that are reversed during the trading day.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **p 3, I**: We conduct three sets of analyses. **In the first\n",
    "we test for short-run persistence in overnight returns.** The basis for expecting this from a\n",
    "measure of sentiment is the evidence in Barber et al. (2009) that the order imbalances of retail\n",
    "investors, who are the investors most likely to exhibit sentiment, persist for periods extending\n",
    "over several weeks...In the third analysis we\n",
